# Customer Churn Prediction

## Project Overview
This project aims to predict whether a customer will churn or not using a basic machine learning model.  
It demonstrates a complete ML workflow from data preprocessing to model evaluation.

## Dataset Source
Telecom Customer Churn Dataset (Public dataset from Kaggle / UCI Repository)

## Steps to Run the Project
1. Clone the GitHub repository
2. Install required dependencies using:
pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Open the Jupyter Notebook located in the `notebooks` folder
4. Run all cells to train and evaluate the model

## Model Used
Logistic Regression

## Final Result Summary
The Logistic Regression model achieved reasonable accuracy in predicting customer churn.  
Model performance was evaluated using accuracy score and confusion matrix.
